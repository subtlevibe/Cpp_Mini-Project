#Introduction

This C++ program implements a functional movie ticket booking system. The system allows users to browse available movies, choose seats, book the user's desired snacks and proceed to secure their tickets. Key features include user-friendly input/output, data validation, and the ability to manage movie schedules and seat availability.

This C++ program creates a simple yet effective movie ticket booking system. Imagine a virtual box office where you can easily find showtimes, pick your seats, and purchase tickets with a few clicks. This program aims to simulate that experience, providing a basic framework for a real-world ticketing application.

#Code Wrap

The provided C++ code implements a robust movie booking system. It leverages bject oriented programming principles to organize the code into well defined classes. Key features include user authentication, movie display with details, seat selection and payment processing. The code utilizes inheritance for code reuseability and modularity. Additionally, it incorporates inline, defaults aruguments, constructors, friend function and friend class, function overloading, console I/O, files, polymorphism, template, classes and objects, exception handling mechanism and several other aspects of C++, data persistence to ensure system reliability and data integrity.
